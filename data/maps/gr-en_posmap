# Mapping from Parole tags used by ILSP NLP tagger for Greek to
# tags used at the Greek side of the Presemt Greek-English dictionary. 
# Tags without a counterpart are left unmapped (meaning that the tag 
# is ignored during matching).
# Matching for Greek only takes place on the first part of the tag.
